1. Download the data from http://emnlp2020-367.hopto.org/data.zip and extract it to a directory <DATA-DIR>.

2. In case you have a GPU supporting tensorflow 1.12, change line 8 in the requirements.txt to:
	tensorflow-gpu==1.12.0

3. Build the docker container.

	docker build -t tokenization-repair .

4. Start the Docker container and link it to the data directory.

	docker run -it -v <DATA-DIR>:/external tokenization-repair

5. Inside the container, repair some tokens!
   Type 'make help' to get a specification of all the make targets.
