Closely related to these operators is the following formula (known as Mecke's formula [\cite=Meck67Form]):

CheMA 1.0 uses truncated normal priors [formula] with parameters [formula] inherited from the corresponding untruncated distribution. Truncation ensures non-negativity of parameters, whilst normality facilitates partial conjugacy (see below); additional information on truncated normals is provided in the Supplementary Information. To simplify notation, we consider a specific variable S and candidate model GS and omit the subscript in what follows. In order to elicit hyperparameters [formula], we follow [\cite=Xu] and assume all processes occur on observable time and concentration scales, that is [formula], reflecting that the data are normalized a priori. For prior covariance of Michaelis-Menten parameters [formula] we assume independence of the components Ki, so that [formula], where [formula] are hyperparameters. For the prior covariance [formula] of maximum reaction rates we take a unit information formulation of the truncated g-prior, so that [formula] and for the noise parameter we use a Jeffreys prior [formula]. These latter choices render the formulation partially conjugate, with the conditional density [formula] given in closed form as
which implies that [formula] can be extended as a map from [formula] to [formula]. The following classical result shows that [formula] maps [formula] to [formula] for all [formula] and all p ∈ ???. In particular, this implies that [formula].
This endomorphism is then represented by the integral matrix [formula] which has complex eigenvalues [formula]. By the theorem then the growth rate is [formula]. To see this directly notice that if n is even then
The assumption that seed solutions g0 are static simplifies all analysis since we can assume that the generating matrix ψ0 becomes diagonal like ψ0 = diag(ψ1, ψ2, ψ3), where ψa (a = 1, 2, 3) are functions which depend on λ, ρ and z. Then, the partial derivative equations for the generating matrix ψ0 are decoupled into each component and therefore, we can solve each ψa (a = 1, 2, 3) independently. The unphysical metric ([\ref=eq:unphys]) becomes
It is also worth noticing that the condition [formula] on the baryon load parameter of a GRB [\citep=2000A&A...359..855R] might constrain on the binary separation a for the occurrence a GRB-SN event. When the NS reaches the critical mass, the distance between the location of the front of the undisturbed SN ejecta and the NS center should be <<a, otherwise the emitted e + e - plasma in the GRB might engulf a large amount of baryonic matter from the SN ejecta, reaching or even overcoming the critical value B ~ 10 - 2.
It is clear that these light curves represent some very generic behaviour. This may be due to a pure viscous evolution, i.e. the outburst disk just evolves under a hot-state viscosity, without the intervention of cooling fronts, until possibly the end of the outburst. Hence any mechanism that prevents the cooling front travelling in from the outer edge of the disk for a sufficiently long time will produce these light curves. In the SXTs irradiation naturally provides that mechanism (e.g. Chen et al. 1993; Van Paradijs 1996; King 1998; King & Ritter 1998), whose presence is suggested (at least near maximum of the outburst) by observations (see e.g. van Paradijs & McClintock 1994; 1995; Shahbaz & Kuulkers 1998). For the outburst of AL Com irradiation may prevent the cooling front from propagating as well, but it is more complicated in this case (see King 1997). If confirmed by more detailed modelling, it may be possible to provide a unified explanation of both cases.
Now we come to see a more general system, the Morse potential. It is also a widely used model in many fields. We take [formula] with D = 150, λ = 0.288, its revival time [formula] can be derived by expanding the wave function with eigen functions of Morse potential, too . With 300 cells in x and 600 cells in p been used in the calculation, the semiclassical wave functions originate from [formula] [formula] are pictured in Fig [\ref=Fig._3]. Comparing to the FFT exact wave functions we can see semiclassical wave functions agree well for different time scales. In Fig [\ref=Fig._3] we plot the normalized classical coordinate space density arising from the initial classical distribution. Since the semiclassical result consists of the square root of classical probabilities multiplied by phase terms and added together, but it is easy to construct its purely classical result by removing the phase terms, and squaring and adding all the square root classical densities.
Firstly, the following is a consequence of Proposition [\ref=prop:fredholm]:
Fig. [\ref=fig:Fig4] (a,b) compares the simulation scenarios of the X1 PL intensity, [formula], where the effect of the Coulomb interactions on the tunnel rates is not included (a) to those where it is included (b) using a ratio of 20:1 between corresponding tunnel rates from indirect and direct initial configurations, e.g. [formula]. The varied parameters are the tunnel rates; according to previous reports [\cite=Wang1] [\cite=Peng.Hermannstaedter.ea:2009] all tunnel rates that correspond to an effective hopping of the hole are set to small values (1 %) compared to the rates that correspond to an effective hopping of the electron. Fig. [\ref=fig:Fig4] (a) clearly shows that none of the simulation results fits the data due to the fast decay of the bright direct exciton population at small times (inset) and the overly slow decay at longer times, which is the result of a balanced tunneling between the different Coulomb interaction configurations (direct/indirect). Fig. [\ref=fig:Fig4] (b) demonstrates that it becomes possible to fit the experimental data when Coulomb interactions are included in the simulation in terms of different tunnel rates depending on the initial state character. The best-fit cuve (green) for the X1 bright exciton recombination, [formula], is obtained for the following tunnel rates: [formula] ns-1 and [formula] ns-1. Fig. [\ref=fig:Fig4] (c,d) shows that the model can describe both the alignment and misalignment cases. The experimental data and simulation results obtained with the best-fit parameter set are displayed for the different electric field tuning situations. The X1 recombination, [formula], is presented in (c) where the upper curve reveals the single-dot like decay below optical saturation (grey) and the lower curve presents the alignment case (green). The X2 recombination, [formula], is presented in (d) where the single-dot like decay case is taken at higher excitation power density leading to the onset of a plateau due to the biexciton-exciton cascaded recombination and saturation effects, which also become visible in the simulation result (grey). The lower curve presents the alignment case (green).
The enhancement of capture cross-section by the quadrupole surface oscillations is significant for soft nuclei with low-energy 2 + states. Such nuclei are often occurred far from the β-stability line. This enhancement of capture rate is negligible in the case of rigid nuclei. Therefore the mass and charge dependencies of the lowest 2 + state are significant for abundances of heavy proton-rich elements in hot star matter [\cite=rp] [\cite=ra]. Reactions with heavier colliding partners are stronger enhanced by the low-energy 2 + oscillations, because the barrier reduction induced by axial quadrupole oscillations of nuclear surface are larger in heavier systems.
The experiment was carried out at the IXS Beamline II (ID28) at the ESRF. The X-rays from an undulator are monochromatized by a double crystal monochromator and a high-energy resolution backscattering monochromator, operating at the silicon (9 9 9) reflection order. The backscattered photons of energy 17794 eV (3×1010 photon/s) are focused by a cylindrical mirror and a Kirkpatrick-Baez multiplayer, providing a focal spot of 30 (horizontal) by 80 (vertical) μm2 Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) at the sample position. The scattered photons are energy-analyzed by a Rowland circle five-crystal spectrometer, with an overall energy resolution δE ≈ 3.0 meV, and detected by a Peltier-cooled silicon diode. The momentum transfer Q = 2ki · sin(θs/2), where ki is the incident photon wave vector and θs is the scattering angle, is selected by rotating the spectrometer around a vertical axis passing through the scattering sample. Spectra at five different momentum transfers can be recorded simultaneously by five independent analyzer systems with a resolution δQ ≈ 0.2 nm-1. We have used a diamond anvil cell (DAC) of the membrane type, equipped with 600 μm culet diamonds. The cell was loaded by condensing high purity liquid oxygen in a sealed vessel at low temperature. Pressure is measured by the shift of the ruby fluorescence wavelength. The sample dimensions were about 300 μm in diameter, and 80 μm in thickness. The IXS measurements were performed at room temperature at 0.88, 2.88 and 5.35 GPa (±0.01 GPa). The highest pressure experimental point is close to the melting line, but still in the fluid phase as was obtained by melting the crystal along an isothermal decompression (300 K) under visual inspection by using a microscope.

The energy per particle obtained from PIMC simulations is reported in figure [\ref=fig14] as a function of temperature and for random potentials with different correlation lengths in the range of the mean interparticle distance. In particular, for the value [formula] we also indicate the value of the superfluid transition temperature. The equation of state and the value of Tc corresponding to the limiting regimes of exceedingly long and short correlation lengths are also shown as a reference. Three important remarks about this figure are worth stressing. a) At fixed particle density and for a given disorder strength the largest suppression of Tc is achieved with [formula] on the order of the interparticle distance. b) At low temperature the energetics of the system is well described by the GP equation even when the disorder is strong and [formula]. c) For random potentials of large strength and with spatial correlations in the range [formula], a window of temperatures opens up where the system is normal (i.e. not superfluid), though highly degenerate (nλ3T > 1).
Now if we take [formula], then it is clear that [formula]. In order to compute Σ1 and Σ2 we use the following summation formulae

The Lognormal Distribution
Introduction
When an external AC-field of suitably high frequency is applied along the hard-axis (y-axis) of the elliptical magnetic particles, the magnetic moments begin to oscillate in the optical mode, which results in a modulation of χ. At the same time, Φ only deviates slightly from its ground state Φ0 = π/2. Therefore, it is a good approximation to take φ = Φ - π/2 ([formula]). Taking all the above assumptions in consideration, Eqs. ([\ref=diff]) can be rewritten as
Turning to the transverse collective modes, when the vacuum is broken by a ferromagnetic spin-spin interaction a region free of single-particle response opens up in the corner of the (ω, q) plane: here is where the Goldstone boson lives. Actually the latter, as we shall see, displays -- in the combined RPA and HF framework and for not too large momenta -- a parabolic (rather than linear) dispersion relation: hence, according to the general theory of the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the non-relativistic regime [\cite=Nie76], it turns out to be a Goldstone mode of second kind. It is remarkable that the RPA-HF theory accounts for its existence through a parabolic dispersion relation, which, however, for larger momenta deviates from the parabolic behavior. Indeed, it develops, just before entering into the particle-hole continuum, a maximum that entails the vanishing of the group velocity of the propagating mode.
The third of these possibilities is feasible, but we do not have the data to confirm or refute it as a mechanism. The second possibility is unlikely, due to the energetic nature of star formation in ULIRGs and from the arguments in [\citet=luh03]. For the first possibility; if the origin of the additional deficit in is grain charging, then we would see a higher G0 in advanced mergers compared to early stage mergers. From Figure [\ref=pdrtoolres3] (see §[\ref=pdrtmodel]) the advanced mergers have a roughly order of magnitude higher value of G0 for about the same n. We therefore infer, cautiously, and with the caveat that we cannot rule out being a major cooling line, that part of the deficit arises due to grain charging in PDRs or in the diffuse ISM. We further propose that this increase in grain charge is not driven mainly by a luminous AGN, obscured or otherwise, since we see no dependence of the deficit on either optical spectral type or the presence of 14.32.
The Wishart distribution originates with a paper by [\cite=Wishart1928] around 80 years ago. Since then, it is considered to be a fundamental distribution not only in mathematical statistics but also in other fields such as random matrices theory and signal processing (e.g., [\cite=Bai1999], [\cite=Maiwald-Kraus2000]). Despite this, the structure of moments of the Wishart distributions is still an active research topic. In the central case, [\cite=Lu-Richards2001], [\cite=Graczyk-etal2003], and [\cite=Graczyk-etal2005] provided formulas for moments of the real and complex Wishart distributions. These studies are based on expansions of the moment generating functions of the central Wishart distributions [formula]. The graph presentations of moments have also been discussed in these studies. Prior to these studies, it was known that terms in the expansion of det(I - Y) - α around Y = 0 have some combinatorial structures (e.g., [\cite=Vere-Jones1988]), which are closely related to the problem of Wishart moment. More recently, [\cite=Letac-Massam2008] provided a method to calculate moments of the noncentral Wishart distribution by combining expansions of the moment generating function [formula] and the "noncentral part" [formula] in ([\ref=mgf-real]).

This implies in particular that [formula] satisfies [\eqref=initial_conditions]. In order to prove that [formula] we have to show that [formula] for every t.
and a proper hopping amplitude t̃ = (πtρ0(0))2/(2T), where [formula], ξ2 = 7ζ(3)v2F/(32π2T2), vF is the Fermi velocity. Due to this replacement, we can systematically evaluate the diagram of arbitrary order in t as depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig4] (b). By using the nonlinear response theory in a manner similar to the fourth-order calculation, we obtain the conductance of the fluctuation pair contribution per spin as

According to i∂ψm/∂t = δE/δψ*m, a set of coupled dynamical equations for the spin components are obtained: with [formula] being the spin-independent part of the Hamiltonian. The density of the m-th component is given by [formula], while [formula] is the total density normalized to the total number of atoms N. The population of each hyperfine state is [formula]. Defining the relative populations λm = Nm/N, the magnetization of the system is M = λ1 - λ - 1. The total number of atoms and the magnetization are both conserved quantities [\cite=Mur06]. Then, the conditions λ1 + λ0 + λ - 1 = 1 and M = λ1 - λ - 1, together with the positiveness of λm, restrict the allowed configurations of the system in the (λ0, M) phase space to the region below the dotted line in Fig. [\ref=fig1].

As discussed previously [\cite=cappelluti99] the above model shows instabilities with respect to a d CDW [\cite=Affleck] [\cite=Chakravarty] and a superconducting phase. The corresponding order parameters are
The measurements have been made using with D1 and D2 detection modules placed in different configurations, as it is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig12], with the individual SiPM bias voltages set for the detection modules responses to fit in four different rate intervals (R1 to R4).

Under this form, the problem appears as minimizing the coupling criterion [formula] which involves the law of the process X under [formula], over all those probability measures [formula] such that the marginal distributions of X at times 0 and T are fixed. This is the general scope of optimal transportation problems as introduced by Monge and Kantorovich; see, for example, Villani [\cite=villani] and Mikami and Thieulen [\cite=mikamithieulen]. Motivated by the present financial application, Tan and Touzi [\cite=TanTouzi] extended the Kantorovich duality as described below. However, the above problem [formula] does not satisfy the assumptions in [\cite=TanTouzi] so that none of the results contained in this literature apply to our context.

Discussion of models using basic factorizations for missing data can be found in a variety of places, including [\citet=glynn] and [\citet=handbook].
Further interest in this system arises from the fact that it is observed as an X-ray source. X-ray emission in early-type binary systems appears as a natural consequence of stellar wind-wind interactions (Chlebowski & Garmany 1991). In such a case, the observed emission is expected to present orbital-phase-related variations. The analysis of such phenomena obviously requires good knowledge of the orbital parameters, and it is important since it provides valuable information about the mass-loss rates and the terminal velocities of the stellar winds. Corcoran (1996) analyzed the X-ray emission from hot, massive stars. HD 165052 was one of the selected targets in which he detected the presence of phase-dependent variations probably associated with wind-wind collision.
In order to push further the comparison between chemical (i.e., rare-earth dependence) and applied pressure, we first need to establish the pressure dependence of the lattice constant a(P). A direct experimental determination of a(P) is still missing, but we can extract this latter quantity from the zero-pressure bulk modulus B0. First of all, from the β-value [formula] of the phononic part of the specific heat in LaTe3 [\cite=Ru] [\cite=SpecHeat] one achieves the sound velocity vs = 1923 m/s [\cite=note]. Knowing that B0 = ρv2s, ρ=6837 kg/m3 being the density, one gets B0 = 25 GPa. We can then assume a linear pressure dependence of the bulk modulus B(P) = B0 + B'P, where B' usually ranges between 4 and 8 [\cite=Bprime]. This leads to the so-called Murnaghan equation for the pressure dependence of the volume [\cite=Murnaghan]:

Algebraic cobordism is universal in both homology and cohomology:
Note that if D2p is the dihedral group of order 2p, then [formula], so the bound in Theorem [\ref=first] is best possible. We also recall that Hung proved in Theorem 1.2 of [\cite=nguyen] that if [formula], then G is solvable. Since 2(p + 1)/(p + 3) < 2 < 11/4, we can Theorem 1.2 [\cite=nguyen] to remove the solvable hypothesis from Theorem [\ref=first].

In fact, a description of spectra Σ(B) in classical spaces was obtained in a rather general setting. These results give us the invertibility conditions for operator B - λI. Apart from the invertibility conditions, some subtle properties of operator B - λI are of considerable interest, such as closedness of the range and one-sided invertibility.
The above interpretation almost certainly involves significant simplification. Observations have shown that magnetospheric processes could exert an extra torque on the crust, perturbing the effects of pure electromagnetic braking [\citep=klo+06] [\citep=lhk+10]. Indeed, out-flowing plasmas could remove enough angular momentum from the star to become the dominant spin-down mechanism, thereby giving n ~ 1. In this scenario, it has been predicted that strong relativistic winds could produce n = 1 [\citep=mic69] [\citep=mdn85] [\citep=ac04b] [\citep=bta+06]. We note, however, that [\citet=oklk10] found no evidence for extended emission around PSR J1734-3333 in X-ray observations, suggesting the absence of a pulsar wind nebula (PWN).
Let us briefly review the original "stroboscopic" feedback scheme for microwave cavities proposed in [\cite=prlno] [\cite=pran]. This proposal is based on a very simple idea: whenever the cavity looses a photon, a feedback loop supplies the cavity mode with another photon, through the injection of an appropriately prepared atom. However, since there are no good enough photodetectors for microwaves, one has to find an indirect way to check if the high-Q microwave cavity has lost a photon or not. In the experiment of Brune et al. [\cite=prlha], information on the cavity field state is obtained by detecting the state of a circular Rydberg atom which has dispersively interacted with the superconducting microwave cavity. This provides an "instantaneous" measurement of the cavity field and suggests that continuous photodetection can be replaced by a series of repeated measurements, performed by non-resonant atoms regularly crossing the high-Q cavity, separated by a time interval τpr.

Introduction
We report here the experimental observation of just such a step increase in the thickness at precisely Tλ, but which only becomes apparent for an extremely slow sweep near the transition. Also, in studies of the critical-fluctuation Casimir effect we have used third sound measurements on the same films to determine the KT onset temperatures, and find that the onset occurs at the very beginning of the dip in thickness.
I used CSR to compute EM(Q) for Q in steps of 0.25, interpolated between these points with a cubic spline and found min EM(Q) over M at every Q (Fig. 3).

In this appendix, we collect some basics about the majorant relation. The materials can be found in the Chapter 5 of [\cite=TZ]. The majorant relation ``≪" is defined in Definition [\ref=Def:_maj1]. Moreover, the majorant relation is also preserved by solving differential equations or integral equations.
In Galactic giant molecular clouds, the pressure of photoionized gas is likely the dominant feedback mechanism that limits the star formation efficiency [\citep=whitworth79] [\citep=williams97a] [\citep=matzner02] [\citep=krumholz06d] [\citep=goldbaum11a]. Photoionization raises gas to a nearly fixed temperature of roughly 104 K, and that temperature is maintained by radiative heating and cooling processes. As the gas expands, it transfers momentum to the surrounding medium. By integrating over the IMF and using a similarity solution to compute the evolution of expanding H ii regions, [\citet=matzner02] estimates that this mechanism injects momentum at a rate [formula] s[formula]. While this is probably the dominant feedback mechanism for GMCs in local galaxies, it is likely to be unimportant for giant clumps, for the simple reason that such clumps have characteristic speeds significantly higher than the ionized gas sound speed, [formula] s[formula] [\citep=kd10]. As a result, ionized gas will be unable to expand and transfer momentum to the cold gas. Recent numerical simulations confirm this conjecture [\citep=dale12a]. We may therefore disregard this mechanism for giant clumps at high redshift.
An extra U(1) (or a few extra [formula]s) may arise in the context of grand unified theories [\cite=Agu90], superstring theories [\cite=Ros88] or generically emerge as simple extensions of the standard model (SM). Therefore, the models with an extra U(1) (or a few extra [formula]s) have been extensively considered. Recently, Barr and Dorsner [\cite=Bar05] suggested another possibility for an extra U(1) gauge, which satisfies all anomaly constraints in a maximally economical way, whatever its origin is. In the standard model, all the possible anomalies from triangle diagrams of three gauge bosons must be canceled if the Ward identities of the gauge theory are to be satisfied. The existence of an extra U(1) brings six additional anomaly cancellation conditions, U(1)2Y × U(1)X, U(1)Y × U(1)2X, U(1)3X, SU(2)2 × U(1)X, SU(3)2 × U(1)X, gravity ×U(1)X. These anomaly cancellations are nontrivial, but Barr and Dorsner showed a remarkably trivial solution [\cite=Bar05] with a single extra lepton triplet per family. These gauge anomalies are exactly canceled for the fermion gauge charges listed at Table I.

In Fig. ([\ref=cross_sec]) the spin independent neutralino-proton cross sections are shown. The 378 models (6 of original 384 removed due to [formula] LSP) are divided into three groupings: those with Ωχh2 > 0.1189 (darker filled triangles), 0.025 < Ωχh2 < 0.1189 (lighter inverted triangles) and Ωχh2 < 0.025 (filled circles). Sensitivity curves for several of the experiments in Table [\ref=experiments] are also shown. Based on the figure it seems that some of the models ought to have given a measurable signal. However, experiments don't measure directly the cross sections, rather they measure counting rates. The two are related, although one must make assumptions about the local halo density as well as the velocity distribution of the relic neutralinos. Furthermore if one rescales the number density by rχ, then none of the models ought to have given signals at experiments. This demonstrates why it is important to work with count rates for which it is also necessary to understand background rates at experiments.

The notation R.N. is taken from [\cite=Zagi81]. We shall not use this notation in the sequel because we define the regularized integral by a different approach. Equality [\eqref=meanzero] is a corollary of the main Theorem of [\cite=Zagi81]. A cancellation occurs in the computation of this mean, and the fact that this mean is zero is important in the derivation of exact main terms in Theorems [\ref=th:dfiA] and [\ref=th:dfiB]. As pointed out in section 2 of [\cite=Zagi81], equality [\eqref=meanzero] may be derived from the Maass-Selberg relations. In fact we shall use the Maass-Selberg relations to establish statement [\eqref=prop3].

In [\cite=Coburn] L.A. Coburn showed that all the isometric representation of the semigroup of non-negative integers generate canonically isomorphic C*-algebras. Later in the papers [\cite=Douglas] R.G. Douglas and G.J. Murphy [\cite=Murphy] proved a similar statement for the semigroups with archimedean order and total order, respectively. In [\cite=AT] it was shown: necessary and sufficient condition for all the non-unitary isometric representations of the semigroup S to generate canonically isomorphic C*-algebras is that the natural order on S is total.
