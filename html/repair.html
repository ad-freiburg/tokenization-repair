      <h2>Demo</h2>
      <p>
        Enter a text sequence with spurious and missing spaces, and potentially with spelling errors.
      </p>
      <form action="repair" method="get">
        <input type="text" name="query" style="width: 100%%" value="%s">

        <p>
          Select a correction method and click the button to submit your query.
          The corrected sequence will be shown below the input form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hyperparameters for this demo are set such that the models work best with unreliable spaces (e.g. no spaces at all).
          Query times are longer than reported in the paper, because the demo is currently set up on a CPU instead of GPU.
