      <h2>Demo</h2>
      <p>
        To test our tokenization repair methods, enter a sequence with missing and spurious spaces and press the submit button.
        The sequence may contain spelling errors, but the goal is only to correct the tokenization errors.
      </p>

          Select a correction method and click the button to submit your query.
          The corrected sequence will be shown below the input form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hyperparameters for this demo are set such that the models work best with unreliable spaces (e.g. no spaces at all) - except for "BID the one" and the spelling corrector.
          Query times are longer than reported in the paper, because the demo is currently set up on a CPU instead of GPU.
