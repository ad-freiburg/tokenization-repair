      <h2>Demo</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Tokenization Repair web demo!<br>
        Enter a sequence with arbitrarily many spurious spaces and missing spaces, and potentially with spelling errors.
        Select a correction method and click the button to submit your query.
        The corrected sequence will be shown below the input form.
      </p>

      <h2>Explanations</h2>
      Hyperparameters for this demo are set such that the models work best with unreliable spaces (e.g. no spaces at all).
      Query times are longer than reported in the paper, because the demo is currently set up on a CPU instead of GPU.

        For a comparison with the Google spell checker, copy your query into a
        <a href="https://docs.google.com">Google document</a> and iteratively apply all suggested space edits.
